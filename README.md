# py3dRenderer
By Redflue

---
This project was made for educational reasons; I wanted to learn about rendering in 3d.

## Controls
```WASD``` To move

```Space / LCtrl``` to change height

```T/G``` to change Focal Length, ```R``` to reset it

```Keyboard Arrows``` to rotate the view when the camera is unlocked, otherwise use you mouse like in any 3d first person game to rotate your view

```Tab``` to lock or unlock the mouse from the screen.

## Dependencies
The project was made using
- ```python 3.10```
- ```pygame 2.5.2``` or higher (as long as its compatible)
- ```compushady``` (for compute shaders)
