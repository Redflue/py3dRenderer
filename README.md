# py3dRenderer
By Redflue

---
This project was made for educational reasons; I wanted to learn about rendering in 3d.

## Controls
```WASD``` To move

```Space / LCtrl``` to change height

```T/G``` to change Focal Length, ```R``` to reset it

```Keyboard Arrows``` to rotate the view

## Dependencies
The project was made using ```python 3.10``` and the ```pygame 2.1.2``` package
